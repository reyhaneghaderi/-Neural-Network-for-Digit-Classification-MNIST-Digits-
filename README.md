#  Neural Network for Digit Classification (MNIST Digits)

This project implements a simple but effective **fully connected neural network** (Multilayer Perceptron) using **TensorFlow** and **Keras** to classify handwritten digits from the `sklearn.datasets.load_digits()` dataset. It's a great demonstration of deep learning fundamentals including data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation.

##  What This Project Does

- Builds and trains a neural network from scratch using **TensorFlow/Keras**.
- Uses **scikit-learn's digits dataset**, a collection of 8x8 grayscale images (0â€“9 digits).
- Preprocesses input data for training (normalization, one-hot encoding).
- Visualizes example inputs and model performance using **Matplotlib**.
- Evaluates accuracy on test data and displays model architecture.

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

### 3. Run the Notebook

Open `neural network project.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code and run all cells step by step.

##  What I Learned

- How to structure and train a neural network using TensorFlow/Keras.
- Best practices for preparing image datasets for deep learning.
- Visualizing neural network predictions and interpreting softmax output.
- Building end-to-end ML pipelines for classification tasks.
